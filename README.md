## Changelog
 - Version 1.0
   
   Created the application and initialised it. For some reason, my first project stopped working
   and no longer accepted commands so now I have to start again last minute.
   Just made the bare mininmum application using blank template and committed.

 - Version 1.1

   Created the base app structure and started setting up the functional components that will be used.
   Added a ```SafeAreaView``` and ```StatusBar``` to make my UI layout more consistent for all devices. 
   Ran into some issues regarding my imports but go that sorted by changing to a more updated import 
   that supports iOS better as well. I added some foundational TS definitions for type safety and scaling.
